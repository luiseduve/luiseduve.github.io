A Software Framework to Integrate Physiological Data in Extended Reality Applications.

## Description

The plugin comprises three modules to:

1. Receive and process physiological activity data (**Physiological Signal Manager**)
2. Log and visualise it in real time, combine it with other sources (e.g., head movement) and create Unity events (**Real Time Monitor**)
3. Visualise and analyse it offline (**Offline Replay / Analysis Tool**).
